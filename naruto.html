            <p><b>Naruto Uzumaki</b> is the main character of the beloved Naruto series and he is a resident of the Hidden Leaf Village in the Land of Fire. Although Naruto was the son of the Fourth Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, he grew up as an orphan in the Hidden Leaf Village. During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox’s attack on the Hidden Leaf, both of Naruto’s parents sacrificed their life, on the day Naruto was born. In his final act, Minato sealed the Yang half of the Nine Tails’ chakra inside the newborn Naruto.<br><br>
            As the Jinchuriki of the Demon Fox, Naruto faced many hardships over the years. He was feared and despised by the residents of the village as they saw him the same as the Demon Fox. This led to Naruto seeking attention from others and he would often pull pranks for the same. This eventually made Naruto decide to become the Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf. He believed if he became the Hokage, no one would ignore him and he would be acknowledged.<br><br>
            In time, he became a member of Team 7, a genin squad of the Hidden Leaf Village consisting of Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno, led by Kakashi Hatake. After his first chunin exams, Naruto studied and honed his skills under the tutelage of MasterJiraiya, one of the Three Legendary Sannin of the Hidden Leaf. Through his hard work and numerous contribution to the well-being of the village, he became the Hero of the Hidden Leaf Village in the Pain Assualt Arc.
